I don't know neo4j but it seems like it might be useful.

These snippets were generated by ChatGPT and adapted to my needs.

For me, learning cypher in the context of cooking makes it concrete.

Don't make me learn graph theory or stare at neo4j documenation for
hours, just give me some examples I can copy/paste.

Later if it turns out using neo4j is doing what I need, then I can
properly pour over the manual to learn what chatgpt did to generate
these snippts.

Please, just give me a shitton of examples that I can
copy/paste...maybe later I'll read the manual.

I can't cook, but I'm annoyed with paying outrageous resturant prices
and I love thai food.

I don't spend enough time in the seattle international district to
know my way around, but I expect I can learn with enough repititon.

# list all nodes and relations

Not sure what a 'node' means other than that its not a 'relation'…I
think.

Either way, i have products, stores…things and 'relations entities' to
connect them.

``` example
MATCH (n) RETURN n;
```

Results:

``` example
# ...truncated to 10 for brevity
```

# list all products

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)
RETURN p;
```

Results:

``` example
# ...truncated to 5 for brevity
```

# list all products

In the realm of cypher, the variable, denoted as 'p' or product, is a
matter of nomenclature flexibility, allowing for usage in both concise
or extensive forms, depending on the intricacies of the cypher context.

When engaged in protracted cypher queries, brevity in naming may be
favored.

However, when interfacing with the Golang driver and conveying results,
employing more elucidative names, such as 'product,' enhances the
readability of the Go code.

``` example
MATCH (product:Product)
RETURN product;
```

Results:

``` example
# ...truncated to 5 for brevity
```

# find cumin in my list of products

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)
WHERE p.name = 'Ground Cumin'
RETURN p;
```

Results:

``` example

[cypher
labels()](https://www.google.com/search?q=neo4j+cypher+labels+function)

# list products with identical names

This reveals that I need to clean up duplicates. Listing two instances
of the same product name is harmful.

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)
WITH p.name AS productName, COLLECT(p) AS products
WHERE SIZE(products) > 1
RETURN productName, products;
```

Results:

``` example
```

[cypher
COLLECT](https://www.google.com/search?q=neo4j+cypher+COLLECT+subquery)

# count duplicates for each product

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)
WITH p.name AS productName, COLLECT(p) AS products
WHERE SIZE(products) > 1
RETURN productName, COUNT(products) AS duplicateCount;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# count products with the same name

In other words how much work do I have to do to cleanup my data?

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)
WITH p.name AS productName, COUNT(p) AS productCount
WHERE productCount > 1
RETURN COUNT(productCount) AS totalDuplicateProducts;
```

Results:

``` example
{"totalDuplicateProducts": 0}
```

# list all products with their urls

Each product can have 0 or more urls.

``` example
for each product
   for each url
      ...
```

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)
WITH p.name AS productName, p.urls AS productUrls

[cypher UNWINDing a
list](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/unwind/#unwind-unwinding-a-list)

# count same-name Product, Store, or Recipe(s)

count entities namely Product, Store or Recipe(s) with the same name

Ok, so it would be useful too to see what other items have the same
name. Thats probably an error.

``` example
// fail:
// MATCH (n)
// WITH n.name AS name, COUNT(n) AS nCount
// WHERE nCount > 1
// RETURN COUNT(nCount) AS totalDuplicateNs, n as N;

// ok:
MATCH (item)
WITH item.name AS itemName, COUNT(item) AS itemCount
WHERE itemCount > 1
RETURN COUNT(itemCount) AS totalDuplicateItems, COLLECT(itemName) AS duplicateItemNames;
```

Results:

``` example
{"duplicateItemNames": [], "totalDuplicateItems": 0}
```

# count same-name Product, Store, or Recipe(s) separately

Entities namely Product, Store or Recipe(s) with the same name as
separate record

Q: Ok, that works great, but now why are the results grouped?

A: this why we need unwind…i think.

``` example
MATCH (item)
WITH item.name AS itemName, COUNT(item) AS itemCount
WHERE itemCount > 1
WITH COUNT(itemCount) AS totalDuplicateItems, COLLECT(itemName) AS duplicateItemNames
UNWIND duplicateItemNames AS duplicateItemName
RETURN totalDuplicateItems, duplicateItemName;
```

Results:

``` example

# BAD: list relation entities with properties

BAD: list relations, not just CONTAINS and show relation properties.

Gotcha! This is wrong. Notice we're missing the is-the-same-as relation.

``` example
MATCH ()-[r]-()
UNWIND keys(r) AS propertyNames
RETURN DISTINCT type(r) AS type, propertyNames AS propertyName
ORDER BY type, propertyName;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# list all relations

``` example
MATCH ()-[r]-()
RETURN DISTINCT type(r) AS relationType
ORDER BY relationType;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# find Vegan Thai Red Curry

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe {name: 'Vegan Thai Red Curry'})-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
RETURN r.name as Recipe, s.name AS Store, COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS ProductNames;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# find Thai Red Curry without specifying exact title

Substring matching with CONTAINS. We didn't specify Vegan Thai Red Curry
here.

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
WHERE r.name CONTAINS 'Thai Red Curry'
MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
RETURN r.name as Recipe, s.name AS Store, COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS ProductNames;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# find Thai Curry with regex

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
WHERE r.name =~ '.*Thai.*Curry.*'
MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
RETURN r.name as Recipe, s.name AS Store, COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS ProductNames;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# find Thai Curry using cypher IN \[\] query format

This returns empty…thats unexpected…

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe)
WHERE 'Thai' IN [r.name] AND 'Curry' IN [r.name]
RETURN r.name AS Recipe;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# find Thai Curry with multiple substings

Why does this return no results?

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
WHERE 'Thai' IN r.name AND 'Curry' IN r.name
MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
RETURN r.name as Recipe, s.name AS Store, COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS ProductNames;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# find Thai Curry with regex case insensitively

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
WHERE r.name =~ '(?i).*thai.*curry.*'
MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
RETURN r.name as Recipe, s.name AS Store, COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS ProductNames;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# search Thai Curry, case-insensitive regex, full details

find Thai Curry with regex case insensitively, output full product
details

We have a map of store to products list. In Go, we can queue the product
list up for each store, then loop over stores to show products we'd need
to purchase for each store.

``` example
MATCH (recipe:Recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(product:Product)
WHERE recipe.name =~ '(?i).*thai.*curry.*'
MATCH (product)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(store:Store)
RETURN recipe.name as RecipeName, store.name AS StoreName, COLLECT(DISTINCT product) AS Products;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# find recipes with either Thai or Curry

``` example
// ok:
// MATCH (r:Recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
// WHERE r.name =~ '(?i).*Thai.*|(?i).*Curry.*'
// MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
// RETURN r.name as Recipe, s.name AS Store, COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS ProductNames;

// better:
MATCH (r:Recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
WHERE r.name =~ '(?i).*(Thai|Curry).*'
MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
RETURN r.name as Recipe, s.name AS Store, COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS ProductNames;
```

Results:

``` example
```

# list products by type

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
RETURN p.name AS ProductName, s.name AS Store, p.type as Type
ORDER BY toLower(p.type);
```

Results:

``` example
# ...truncated to 10 for brevity
```

# list products that I've not yet assiged a type to

``` example
MATCH (p:Product)
WHERE p.type IS NULL
RETURN p.name;
```

Results:

# list details about product urls

What the hell is this one…I've forgotten.

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe)-[c:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
WHERE id(p) IS NULL
RETURN r.name AS Recipe, c.quantity AS Quantity, c.urls AS RecipeUrls;

# find purchasing info for 10 products

list products that don't have a store associated with them, but limit to
10

Data cleanup is a pain in the ass and I want to take it in bite size
pieces, so randomize the list to keep me interested and return just 10
to keep me from being disheartended.

``` example
// fail:
// MATCH (product:Product)
// WHERE NOT (product)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(:Store)
// WITH product
// ORDER BY RAND()
// RETURN product.name AS ProductName
// ORDER BY ProductName
// LIMIT 10;

// fail:
// MATCH (product:Product)
// WHERE NOT (product)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(:Store)
// WITH product
// ORDER BY RAND()
// WITH COLLECT(product) AS randomProducts
// UNWIND randomProducts AS product
// RETURN product.name AS ProductName
// ORDER BY ProductName
// LIMIT 10;

// fail:
// MATCH (product:Product)
// WHERE NOT (product)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(:Store)
// WITH product
// ORDER BY RAND()
// LIMIT 10
// RETURN product.name AS ProductName;

// fail:
// MATCH (product:Product)
// WHERE NOT (product)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(:Store)
// WITH product
// ORDER BY RAND()
// LIMIT 10
// WITH COLLECT(product) AS randomProducts
// UNWIND randomProducts AS product
// ORDER BY product.name
// RETURN product.name AS ProductName;

// works:
MATCH (product:Product)
WHERE NOT (product)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(:Store)
WITH product
ORDER BY RAND()
LIMIT 10
RETURN product.name AS ProductName
ORDER BY ProductName;

# BAD: list the entity type the property is assocted with

This is crap. Results are duplicated.

``` example
MATCH (n)
UNWIND labels(n) AS label
UNWIND keys(n) AS propertyName
RETURN label, propertyName;
```

Results:

``` example
# ...truncated to 10 for brevity

# GOOD: list the entity type the property is assocted with

Here's how we can add distinct to eliminates duplicates…makes it not
crap.

``` example
MATCH (n)
UNWIND labels(n) AS label
UNWIND keys(n) AS propertyName
RETURN DISTINCT label, propertyName;
```

Results:

``` example

# list unique entities

``` example
MATCH (n)
WITH DISTINCT labels(n) AS distinctLabels, keys(n) AS propertyNames
UNWIND distinctLabels AS label
UNWIND propertyNames AS propertyName
RETURN DISTINCT label, propertyName;
```

# list CONTAINS relationships

This doesn't help in the least bit…the properties are identical…find a
better way.

``` example
MATCH ()-[r:CONTAINS]-()
UNWIND keys(r) AS propertyNames
RETURN type(r) AS type, propertyNames AS propertyName
ORDER BY type, propertyName;
```

Results:

``` example
# ...truncated to 5 for brevity

# list unique CONTAINS relationship properties

``` example
MATCH ()-[r:CONTAINS]-()
UNWIND keys(r) AS propertyNames
RETURN DISTINCT type(r) AS type, propertyNames AS propertyName
ORDER BY type, propertyName;

# GOOD: list relation entities and their properties

GOOD: list relations, not just CONTAINS and show relation properties

This fixes the item in section: 'BAD: list relations, not just CONTAINS

# minimize travel for recipe ingredients

If I would like to make a particular recipe, then what stores do I need
to visit and sort products by stores so I don't have to leave and return
because I didn't realize there were two products from the same store

Also, make sure that if a recipe has an item that is not assigned to a
store by the PURCAHSE<sub>AT</sub> relation, then the store field
appears empty as opposed to not seeing the product at all

``` example
MATCH (r:Recipe {name: 'Korean Sesame Noodles'})-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:PURCHASE_AT]->(s:Store)
WITH p, COLLECT(DISTINCT s) AS stores
RETURN COLLECT(DISTINCT p.name) AS Products,
       [store IN stores | CASE WHEN store IS NOT NULL THEN store.name ELSE 'Unknown' END] AS Stores
ORDER BY [store IN Stores | toLower(store)];

# BAD: remove duplicate ingredients

BAD: some recipes point to the same product multiple times by mistake

This doesn't do what I expect. Need to spend more time iterating.

WHERE SIZE(products) > 1
RETURN r, products;

# cleanup data, find recipes with unknown products

This is data cleanup task.

Find all recipes that have products whose product names are empty or
that the product by mistake doesn't yet exist. Its an error in the data.

Once you've found the recipes, then list all the products associated
with this recipe. We will need to compare that list.

``` example
MATCH (recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(product)
WHERE product.name IS NULL
WITH recipe
MATCH (recipe)-[:CONTAINS]->(allProducts)
RETURN recipe.name AS RecipeName, allProducts.name AS ProductName;
```
