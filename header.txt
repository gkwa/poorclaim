I don't know neo4j but it seems like it might be useful.

These snippets were generated by ChatGPT and adapted to my needs.

For me, learning cypher in the context of cooking makes it concrete.

Don't make me learn graph theory or stare at neo4j documenation for
hours, just give me some examples I can copy/paste.

Later if it turns out using neo4j is doing what I need, then I can
properly pour over the manual to learn what chatgpt did to generate
these snippts.

Please, just give me a shitton of examples that I can
copy/paste...maybe later I'll read the manual.
