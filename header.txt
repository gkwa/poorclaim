I don't know neo4j but it seems like it might be useful.

Don't make me learn the theory or stare at documenation for hours,
just give me some examples I can copy/paste...then later if it turns
out using neo4j seems like the right path, then I can pour laborously
over the manual.

Please, just give me a shitton of examples that I can
copy/paste...maybe later I'll read the manual.
